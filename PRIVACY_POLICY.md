# Crocket's Classic Cards: Privacy Policy

Welcome to the Crocket's Classic Cards app for Android!

This app is a personal project of mine and I want to be clear in that, to
the best of my knowledge, this app has not been programmed to collect any
personally identifiable information.

## Data Collected

This app uses Firebase Analytics, which will collect data, but that data
will be anonymous (i.e. there is no personally identifiable information
collected along with this data).

Data collected includes: approximate location (country), number of active
users, number of crashes, etc. All of which is collected for the purposes of analytics, and is only used to monitor the state of the app, and nothing more.

If there are any concerns about the data stored by the app, please reach out to me using my contact information below.
